"The E-Commerce Warehouse System"
You are building the backend core for an online store. You need to handle different types of products, manage stock securely, and compare products.

Theme: Use Classes, Inheritance, Private Fields, and Static Methods.

Requirements:
The Base Class: Product
Constructor: Accepts name, price, and stock.

Encapsulation: Make price a private field (#price).
Getter: get price() should return the price with a currency sign (e.g., "$500").
Setter: set price(value) should preventing setting a negative price.
Method: displayInfo() returns "Product: [name], Stock: [stock]".

The Subclass: Electronic
Inheritance: Use extends Product.
Constructor: Accepts name, price, stock, and warrantyPeriod.
Super: You MUST use super(name, price, stock) inside the constructor.
Polymorphism: Override displayInfo(). It should return the parent's info plus "Warranty: [warrantyPeriod] years".

The Static Utility
Add a static method inside Product called compareStock(product1, product2).
It should return the Name of the product that has more stock.

Execution Scenario (Write this at the bottom):
Create a Product (e.g., "Generic Shirt", 500, 20).

Create an Electronic (e.g., "Laptop", 150000, 5, 2).
Try to set the Laptop price to -100 (Should trigger your error logic).
Call displayInfo() on both (See how they behave differently).
Call Product.compareStock(shirt, laptop) and print the winner.
