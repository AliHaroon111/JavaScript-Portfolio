🚀 Mini Project: "The Tea Shop Terminal"
You are building a simple backend logic for a tea shop (inspired by your teaTypes variable). You need to calculate a customer's total bill and check if they qualify for a membership discount.

Goal: Create a file named teashop.js and write code to solve this scenario.

Scenario Requirements:
Define Prices (Const):

Create a const variable for the price of lemonTea (e.g., 50).

Create a const variable for the price of coffee (e.g., 100).

Customer Order (Let):

Create variables for the quantity ordered: numTeas (e.g., 3) and numCoffees (e.g., 2).

Calculate Total:

Calculate the subTotal using multiplication and addition.

Membership Logic (Logical Operators):

Create a variable isMember = true.

Create a variable totalSpend = subTotal.

Logic: If the user is a Member (isMember) AND (&&) their totalSpend is greater than 300, print "You qualify for a discount!".

Tip: You can use console.log(isMember && totalSpend > 300) to see a true/false result.

The Receipt (Console Table):

Use console.table to print the final details (e.g., { Item: "Total Bill", Cost: subTotal }).
