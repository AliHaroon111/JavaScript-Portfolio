/**
Mini-Project: "The Spinning Mill Production Recorder (CLI)"

 Initialize an empty array: let productionLog = [].
Start a do-while loop.
Inside the loop, use prompt-sync to ask for:
Machine ID (e.g., "M-101")
Production Count (e.g., "500"). Important: Convert this to a Number immediately!
Validation Logic:
If the user enters a production count equal to 0, do not add it to the array. Print "Machine reported breakdown, skipping."
Otherwise, create an object: { id: machineInput, count: productionNumber } and push it into productionLog.
Ask the user: "Add another machine? (yes/no)".
The loop should continue only if the user types "yes".
 
 
Phase 2: The Report Generator (for-of)
After the user says "no", the program should print a report.

Initialize totalProduction = 0.

Use a for-of loop to iterate through your productionLog.

Accumulate: Add each machine's count to totalProduction.

Audit Check (Logic inside Loop):

If a machine's production is less than 100, print: "⚠️ Low Output Alert: Machine [ID]"

Final Output:

Print the "Total Mill Production".

Print the "Number of Active Machines" (Array length).
