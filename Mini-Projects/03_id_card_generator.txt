Mini Project: "The University ID Card Generator"
You are building a system to generate digital ID cards for COMSATS students. This project requires using Objects, Symbols (for unique IDs), and Template Literals.

Goal: Create a file named id_card.js.

Requirements:

Create a Symbol:

Create a unique symbol for the student's database ID: const idSym = Symbol("id").

Create a Student Object:

The object should have these properties:

name (String, e.g., "Ali Haroon")

"full roll no" (String with spaces, e.g., "FA24-BCS-099") -> Requires bracket notation to access later!

[idSym] (Use the symbol variable as a key) -> Syntax: [idSym]: "12345" inside the object.

subjects (Array, e.g., ["DAA", "Web", "Calculus"]).

Data Processing (Type Conversion):

Assume you received the student's semester fee as a string from a form: let feeString = "55000".

Convert it to a real Number: let feeNum = ...

Add a penalty of 500 to the fee.

Print the Card (Template Literals):

Use backticks ` to print a formatted ID card.

It must display the Name, the "Full Roll No", the first subject in their list (index 0), and the Final Fee Total.
